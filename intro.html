<p><b>The ecological footprint is a measure of our resource use, and indicates the extent to which we are overshooting the available biocapacity of the earth. If you total up all the biocapacity and divide it by the global population, you end up with a fair share of approximately 1.8 global hectares per person. Citizens in Asia generally consume so many resources that, if everyone were to live like us, we'd need three times the biocapacity of the earth to support us.<br>

Biocapacity is divided into six main land types:<br>
-Cropland - subdivided into primary and marginal land (e.g. wheat and olives), measured in tonnes per hectare per year of crop that you can harvest<br>
-Pasture - tonnes per hectare per year of meat/dairy, though the total footprint of the livestock will take into account the cropland and fishieries needed for animal feed<br>
-Forestry - metres cubed per hectare per year, there is no difference between natural or managed land<br>-Fisheries - the maximum sustainably caught yield in tonnes per hectare per year<br>-Carbon - the area of forestry required to sequester the tonnage of carbon dioxide, including nuclear which is considered to be equivalent to fossil fuels<br>
-Build up land - considered to be replacing primary cropland, though this assumption is obviously shaky, e.g. think of Dubai or Tibet</b><br></p>
